**DETAIL ANY MAJOR CHANGES MADE IN THE NEW SCRIPT**

**DAM SURVIVAL IN BURN-IN**

In the original burnin.R file, initialized juvenile survival was subjected to outmigrating mortality at dams. This would have the effect of reducing the number of juveniles available to start the "natural" population in the burn-in period. 

**KELT SURVIVAL IN BURN-IN**

In the original burnin.R file, initialized kelt survival was subjected to outmigrating mortality at dams. This would have the effect of reducing the number of reconditioning fish available to start the "natural" population in the burnin-in period.
